# My First ASP.NET Core API - Workout Tracker

Welcome to my first ASP.NET Core API project! This repository contains a simple API built using ASP.NET Core to help me learn and practice building RESTful services. The API is a **Workout Tracker**, and currently includes user management with basic CRUD operations and authentication features.

## Project Overview

This API is designed to manage users and will eventually include features for tracking workouts and other fitness-related data. The current features include:

- **User Management**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for users.
- **Authentication**: User login with JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure access.

### Features

- **CRUD Operations for Workouts**:
- **CRUD Operations for Exercises**:
- **CRUD Operations for Exercise Equipment**:
- **CRUD Operations for Workout Exercise**:
- **User Authentication JWT token**:

### Future Features

- **Integration with Third-Party Services**: Integration with other fitness apps or services for enhanced functionality.
- **Frontend Client**: Building a frontend client using React/Next.js or similar technology for a user-friendly interface.

### Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core**: The web framework used to build the API.
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM used for data access.
- **JWT**: For secure user authentication.
- **BCrypt**: For password hashing.
